# Stock Adjustment Management System

This is a full-stack application for managing stock adjustment requests, built with Node.js (Express), React, and SQLite.

## Project Structure

-   `backend/`: Contains the Node.js Express API.
-   `frontend/`: Contains the React user interface.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Navigate to the project root directory**:

    ```bash
    cd stock-adjustment-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for both frontend and backend**:

    ```bash
    npm run install-all
    ```

    *Alternatively, you can install them separately:*

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

From the project root directory, run:

```bash
npm start
